## 📖 Description

**Legacy Nether: Extended** is an expansion of the original **Legacy Nether** mod that blends the nostalgic feel of the old console-era Nether with the **new features** of Minecraft’s modern Nether.

This mod is designed for players who want the **aesthetics and gameplay vibe of the console Nether**, but also want to keep **Netherite, Bastions, and new biomes** so nothing is missing from modern Minecraft.

Where the original Legacy Nether stripped back the Nether to its barebones, **Extended** reimagines it by **integrating modern content in a console-inspired style**, giving you the best of both worlds.

Some of the features include:

* **Bastion Remnants, fortresses, and other structures** are present, styled to fit alongside the classic Nether Wastes environment.
* **Modern biomes** such as Crimson Forests and Soul Sand Valleys generate naturally, but mob spawning and loot tables are tuned to evoke the console editions.
* **Ancient Debris and Netherite** progression are fully supported for players who want modern endgame content.
* **Piglins, Hoglins, Striders**, and other new mobs spawn alongside classic mobs like Zombified Piglins, Ghasts, Magma Cubes, and Wither Skeletons.
* **Nether Wart** still spawns on Soul Sand in the wild. **(Thanks to @Soupio777)**
* **Blaze Glowstone Dust drops** remain for nostalgia farming.
